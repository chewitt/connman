Storage
============

Service		net.connman
Interface	net.connman.Storage
Object path	/

Methods		void ChangeUser(uint32 uid)

			Change the user for storage. This affects WiFi and
			VPN service use. Both WiFi and VPN services are loaded
			from the users' storage paths, other services are
			shared with main user (usually, root). User also has
			own main settings file defining the offline state as
			well as the states of each technology. Each technology
			is first put down to make sure that correct state is
			restored. Offline state is changed according to
			configuration. Change is in effect first with vpnd,
			and if successful then connmand will do the change as
			well.

			User id (uid) must be a valid uid in the system for an
			user that has a valid login shell. If the user id is
			not valid InvalidArguments error is returned.

			If a VPN has a regular, non-system user set as user to
			run the VPN binary the changed user overrides the
			configured user. In case system user is used override
			is not used. This is a VPN configuration specific.

			If the user is already enabled nothing is done. Error
			AlreadyEnabled is returned instead.

			If the user calling the method is not allowed to use
			the method PermissionDenied error is returned.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.AlreadyEnabled
					 [service].Error.PermissionDenied
