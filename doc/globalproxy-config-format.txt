Connman configuration file format for global proxy
**************************************************

The persistent state of the global proxy is retained in the global proxy
configuration file. This is expected to have the filename
STORAGEDIR/global_proxy/settings. STORAGEDIR by default points to
/var/lib/connman/.

For general information about how connman configuration files are structured,
please refer to config-format.txt.

If the configuration file is changed, connman will update the global proxy
settings to reflect the values stored in the file. Contrariwise if the global
proxy configuration is changed (e.g. in response to a dbus call) the file
will be updated to reflect the new configuration.

The format of the global proxy configuration file mirrors the fields used in 
configuration files for services related to proxy configuration. The format of 
the file can be summarised as follows (with a more detailed explanation below).

[global proxy]
Active = <true|false>
Proxy.Method = <direct|manual|auto>
Proxy.Servers = <url;...>
Proxy.Excludes = <domain;...>
Proxy.URL = <url>


Global proxy section [global proxy]
===================================

This is currently the only section in a global proxy configuration file.

Allowed fields:
- Active: This field can take a value of "true" or "false". Each service can
  have its own individual proxy settings, but if the global proxy is active, it
  will override the proxy configurations of the individual services.
- Proxy.Method: This field represents the type of proxy to use. It takes one
  of the values "direct", "manual" or "auto". When the method is "direct", no
  proxy will be used and requests will be passed directly to their destination.
  When the method is "manual" a "Proxy.Servers" field must be provided listing
  the proxies to use for requests; an optional "Proxy.Excludes" field may also
  be included in this case. When the method is "auto" a "Proxy.URL" field must
  be included to identify the location of a pac file that will be downloaded and
  queried in order to determine the appropriate proxy to use.
- Proxy.Servers: A semicolon-separated list of servers to use as proxies. Each
  server should include a transport prefix (e.g. "https://") and a port number
  postfix (e.g. :8080). This field is required if the method is set to "manual",
  otherwise it's optional.
- Proxy.Excludes: A semicolon-separated list of domains which are to be
  contacted directly (i.e. without first going via the proxy). This field
  applies in the case the method is set to "manual", and is optional.
- Proxy.URL: A URL pointing to a pac file to query in order to establish the
  appropriate proxy to use. This field is required if the method is set to
  "auto", otherwise it's optional.


Examples
========

The following file will override any service-specific proxy settings, so that
no proxy is used.

[global proxy]
Active = true
Proxy.Method = direct

The following file will override any service-specific proxy settings, so that 
either https://jolla.com, or http://mer.org will be used as a proxy. No proxy 
will be used for requests to the sailfishos.org domain.

[global proxy]
Active = true
Proxy.Method = direct
Proxy.Servers = https://jolla.com;http://mer.org;
Proxy.Excludes = sailfishos.org

The following file will override any service-specific proxy settings. The pac
file located at https://jolla.com/example.pac will be used to determine the
proxy to use for each request.

[global proxy]
Active = true
Proxy.Method = auto
Proxy.URL = https://jolla.com/example.pac

The following file configures the global proxy, but does not active it.

[global proxy]
Active = false
Proxy.Method = manual
Proxy.Servers = https://jolla.com;http://mer.org;
Proxy.Excludes = jolla.com;mer.org;
