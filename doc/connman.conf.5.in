.SH NAME
main.conf \- ConnMan configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @sysconfdir@/connman/main.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
.B main.conf
is a configuration file for ConnMan. The configuration file is
optional but it can be used to set up various aspects of ConnMan's
behavior. The location of the file may be changed through use of
the \fB\-\-config= \fRargument for \fBconnman\fP(8).
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.P
The configuration file consists of sections (groups) of key-value pairs.
Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments.
Sections are started by a header line containing the section enclosed
in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next section
or the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.
.P
Description of sections and available keys follows:
.SS [General]
This section is the only mandatory section of the configuration file.
.TP
.BI InputRequestTimeout= secs
Set input request timeout. Default is 120 seconds
The request for inputs like passphrase will timeout
after certain amount of time. Use this setting to
increase the value in case of different user
interface designs.
.TP
.BI BrowserLaunchTimeout= secs
Set browser launch timeout. Default is 300 seconds
The request for launching a browser for portal pages
will timeout after certain amount of time. Use this
setting to increase the value in case of different
user interface designs.
.TP
.BI BackgroundScanning=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Enable background scanning. Default is true.
If wifi is disconnected, the background scanning will follow a simple
backoff mechanism from 3s up to 5 minutes. Then, it will stay in 5
minutes unless user specifically asks for scanning through a D-Bus
call. If so, the mechanism will start again from 3s. This feature
activates also the background scanning while being connected, which
is required for roaming on wifi.
When BackgroundScanning is false, ConnMan will not perform any scan
regardless of wifi is connected or not, unless it is requested by
the user through a D-Bus call.
.TP
.BI UseGatewaysAsTimeservers=true \fR|\fB\ false
Assume that service gateways also function as timeservers.
Default is false.
.TP
.BI FallbackTimeservers= server\fR[,...]
List of Fallback timeservers separated by ",".
These timeservers are used for NTP sync when there are
no timeservers set by the user or by the service, and
when UseGatewaysAsTimeservers = false. These can contain
a mixed combination of fully qualified domain names, IPv4
and IPv6 addresses.
.TP
.BI FallbackNameservers= server\fR[,...]
List of fallback nameservers separated by "," appended
to the list of nameservers given by the service. The
nameserver entries must be in numeric format, host
names are ignored.
.TP
.BI DefaultAutoConnectTechnologies= technology\fR[,...]
List of technologies that are marked autoconnectable
by default, separated by commas ",". The default value
for this entry when empty is ethernet,wifi,cellular.
Services that are automatically connected must have been
set up and saved to storage beforehand.
.TP
.BI DefaultFavoriteTechnologies= technology\fR[,...]
List of technologies that are marked favorite by default,
separated by commas ",". The default value for this entry
when empty is ethernet. Connects to services from this
technology even if not setup and saved to storage.
.TP
.BI AlwaysConnectedTechnologies= technology\fR[,...]
List of technoolgies which are always connected regardless
of PreferredTechnologies setting (AutoConnect = true). The
default value is empty and this feature is disabled unless
explicitly enabled in the config file.
.TP
.BI PreferredTechnologies= technology\fR[,...]
List of preferred technologies from the most preferred
one to the least preferred one separated by commas ",".
Services of the listed technology type will be tried one
by one in the order given, until one of them gets connected
or they are all tried. A service of a preferred technology
type in state 'ready' will get the default route when
compared to another preferred type further down the list
with state 'ready' or with a non-preferred type; a service
of a preferred technology type in state 'online' will get
the default route when compared to either a non-preferred
type or a preferred type further down in the list.
.TP
.BI NetworkInterfaceBlacklist= interface\fR[,...]
List of blacklisted network interfaces separated by ",".
Found interfaces will be compared to the list and will
not be handled by connman, if their first characters
match any of the list entries. Default value is
vmnet,vboxnet,virbr,ifb.
.TP
.BI AllowHostnameUpdates=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Allow connman to change the system hostname. This can
happen for example if we receive DHCP hostname option.
Default value is true.
.TP
.BI AllowDomainnameUpdates=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Allow connman to change the system domainname. This can
happen for example if we receive DHCP domainname option.
Default value is true.
.TP
.BI SingleConnectedTechnology=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Keep only a single connected technology at any time. When a new
service is connected by the user or a better one is found according
to PreferredTechnologies, the new service is kept connected and all
the other previously connected services are disconnected. With this
setting it does not matter whether the previously connected services
are in 'online' or 'ready' states, the newly connected service is
the only one that will be kept connected. A service connected by the
user will be used until going out of network coverage. With this
setting enabled applications will notice more network breaks than
normal. Default value is false.
.TP
.BI TetheringTechnologies= technology\fR[,...]
List of technologies that are allowed to enable tethering separated by ",".
The default value is wifi,bluetooth,gadget. Only those technologies listed
here are used for tethering. If one wants to tether ethernet,
then add "ethernet" in the list.
NOTE that if ethernet tethering is enabled, then a DHCP server is
started on all ethernet interfaces. Tethered ethernet should
never be connected to corporate or home network as it will disrupt
normal operation of these networks. Due to this ethernet is not
tethered by default. Do not activate ethernet tethering unless you
really know what you are doing.
.TP
.BI PersistentTetheringMode=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Restore earlier tethering status when returning from offline mode,
re-enabling a technology, and after restarts and reboots.
Default value is false.
.TP
.BI Enable6to4=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Automatically enable Anycast 6to4 if possible. This is not recommended, as the
use of 6to4 will generally lead to a severe degradation of connection quality.
See RFC6343.  Default value is false (as recommended by RFC6343 section 4.1).
.TP
.BI VendorClassID= string
Set DHCP option 60 (Vendor Class ID) to the given string. This option can
be used by DHCP servers to identify specific clients without having to
rely on MAC address ranges, etc
.TP
.BI EnableOnlineCheck=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Enable or disable use of HTTP GET as an online status check.
When a service is in a READY state, and is selected as default,
ConnMan will issue an HTTP GET request to verify that end-to-end
connectivity is successful. Only then the service will be
transitioned to ONLINE state.
If this setting is false, the default service will remain in READY state.
Default value is true.
.TP
.BI AutoConnectRoamingServices=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Automatically connect roaming services. This is not recommended unless you know
you won't have any billing problem.
Default value is false.
.TP
.BI AddressConflictDetection=true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Enable or disable the implementation of IPv4 address conflict detection
according to RFC5227. ConnMan will send probe ARP packets to see if an
IPv4 address is already in use before assigning the address to an interface.
If an address conflict occurs for a statically configured address, an IPv4LL
address will be chosen instead (according to RFC3927). If an address conflict
occurs for an address offered via DHCP, ConnMan send a DHCP DECLINE once and
for the second conflict resort to finding an IPv4LL address.
Default value is false.
.TP
.BI FallbackDeviceTypes= interface:devtype\fR[,...]
If /sys/class/net/<interface>/uevent does not contain DEVTYPE information,
heuristics are used to choose between wifi and ethernet device types. If
neither is appropriate, this setting can be used to provide more suitable
fallback value - e.g. rndis0:gadget.
.TP
.BI StorageRoot= string
The root storage dir ConnMan uses for creating connman and connman-vpn
directories into. This defaults to the build time directory, usually /var/lib
if omitted. This directory will be created with StorageRootPermissions if it
does not exist.
.TP
.BI StorageRootPermissions= permissions (int)
Permissions for creating StorageRoot directory when it does not exist yet.
The permissions must be given in the Linux File Permissions format using
Binary references. Defaults to 0755.
.TP
.BI StorageDirPermissions= permissions (int)
Permissions to create directories into StorageRoot. These permsisions are
used for connman, connman-vpn and all the service and provider subdirectories
when they are created. The permissions must be given in the Linux File
Permissions format using Binary references. Defaults to 0700.
.TP
.BI StorageFilePermissions= permissions (int)
Permissions for files created inside connman and connman-vpn subdirectories
and into the respective service directories. The permissions must be given in
the Linux File Permissions format using Binary references. Defaults to 0600.
.TP
.BI Localtime= string
Path to localtime file. Defaults to /etc/localtime.
.TP
.BI RegdomFollowsTimezone= true\ \fR|\fB\ false
Enable regdomain to be changed along timezone changes. With this option set to
true each time the timezone changes the first present ISO3166 country code is
being read from /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone1970.tab and set as regdom value.
.BI OnlineCheckInitialInterval= secs, OnlineCheckMaxInterval= secs
Range of intervals between two online check requests.
When an online check request fails, another one is triggered after a
longer interval. The intervals follow the power of two series of numbers
between OnlineCheckInitialInterval and OnlineCheckMaxInterval.
Default range is [1, 12], corresponding to the following intervals, in
seconds: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121 and 144.
.TP
Default value is false.
